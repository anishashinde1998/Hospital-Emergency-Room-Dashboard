## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers in-depth analysis of hospital emergency room (ER) performance — patient flow, wait times, admissions, referrals, and demographics.  
The dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize ER efficiency, reduce wait times, and improve patient satisfaction.

Views included:  
- **Monthly view** (March 2024)  
- **Consolidated view** (April 2023 – October 2024)  
- **Day/hour trends, referral patterns, age groups, race distribution**, etc.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**, including custom **DAX formulas** for aggregations, time intelligence, filtering, and calculation logic  
- Data source: CSV / Excel dataset
